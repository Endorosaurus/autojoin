# autojoin
Late for you Zoom classes? Then use autojoin! A python program that automatically joins Zoom classes for you, is easily customizable, and is 100% free!

HOW TO USE:

1. If you have never used Python before, download it by going to python.org/downloads and do the installation procedure

2. After that run either [python3 get-pip.py] or [python get-pip.py] in your terminal or command prompt to install pip which is used to install dependencies

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES: 

1. You will need to install quite a few dependencies, so stay with me.

2. Open up terminal/command prompt if not open, and do these following commands:
[pip install datetime]
[pip install ast]
[pip install winsound]
[pip install webbrowser]
[pip install pyttsx3]

3. Some of these commands might say that they're already installed, in which case don't worry, just continue on to the next one. Contact me if there are any errors.
