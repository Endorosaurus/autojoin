# autojoin
Late for you Zoom classes? Then use autojoin! A python program that automatically joins Zoom classes for you, is easily customizable, and is 100% free!

This program has been created by Endorosaurus on GitHub. Please do not share without crediting me first. If you were to share send a link leading back here so people can check out my other future projects!

The .py file (if just double clicked, no code editor or anything) will open up a console window and say "Autojoin has started" to signal it's beginning. This one is easy to close (ctrl + c), but it does add an extra window
The .pyw file on the other hand, (again double clicked no code editor) won't open any windows but will be a bit harder to close since the two options are to delete a random comma in the text file, save, and then add it back or to go to task manager or other such apps.

There is Colon support now in my most recent update I did from a plane on 5/15/2021 at 1:35 PM or so. All files should have been updated.

HOW TO USE:

1. If you have never used Python before, download it by going to python.org/downloads and do the installation procedure

2. After that run either [python3 get-pip.py] or [python get-pip.py] in your terminal or command prompt to install pip which is used to install dependencies

INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES: 

1. You will need to install quite a few dependencies, so stay with me.

2. Open up terminal/command prompt if not open, and do these following commands:
[pip install datetime]
[pip install ast]
[pip install winsound]
[pip install webbrowser]
[pip install pyttsx3]

3. Some of these commands might say that they're already installed, in which case don't worry, just continue on to the next one. Contact me if there are any errors.
