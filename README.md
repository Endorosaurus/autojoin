# autojoin
Late for you Zoom classes? Then use autojoin! A python program that automatically joins Zoom classes for you, is easily customizable, and is 100% free!

This program has been created by Endorosaurus on GitHub. Please do not share without crediting me first. If you were to share send a link leading back here so people can check out my other future projects!

The .py file (if just double clicked, no code editor or anything) will open up a console window and say "Autojoin has started" to signal it's beginning. This one is easy to close (ctrl + c), but it does add an extra window
The .pyw file on the other hand, (again double clicked no code editor) won't open any windows but will be a bit harder to close since the two options are to delete a random comma in the text file, save, and then add it back or to go to task manager or other such apps.

This program can have infinite links, they don't have to be Zoom links, and uses 24 hour time. Don't add a colon (":") or it will break it. If requested I can add Colon support

This is Endo signing out, send questions/ideas to mishamojang@gmail.com
Take care!
